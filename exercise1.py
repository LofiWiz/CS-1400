# Exercise 1

# 1:

# Python Shell: The shell allows you to type in expressions and recieve immediate feed back
#               by typing after the prompt ">>>".
#
# Python Editor: A text based editor that will allow you to code in the python syntax
#               and to create/save a file so that you can then send it to be compiled and interpreted.

# 2:
# a) Hello, world!
# b) Hello World!
# c) 3
# d) 3.0
# e) 5
# f) 5.0
# g) 23
# h) 2 + 3 = 5
# i) 6
# j) 8
# k) 2.3333333333333335
# l) 2

# 3:

# Chaos Program:
print("this program illustrates a chaotic function.")
x = float(input("enter a number between 0 and 1: "))
for i in range(10):
    x = 3.9 * x * (1 - x)
    print(x)

# .25 and .26 are relatively similar in the sense that they both
# are near the same numbers at the same times, in general the function
# tends to be "chaotic", i haven't ever heard of one before and so
# I don't know what they do or really even what i am looking at.

# 4:
# algorithm: a sequence of instructions that lead to a solution
# compiler: Reads the high level program all at once in one go,
#           and then continues on to run the program all at once.
# Interpreter: reads a high level program line by line, processing
#             it and alternating between lines to run what it just read.
# High level language: high level languages are what we use to "code"
#             they are make creating programs faster and more efficient
#             and can be used among several devices; eventually the
#             high level language becomes the machine code used to run
#             the end product program that is executed.
